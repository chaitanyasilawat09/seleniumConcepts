There are complex interactions like Drag-n-Drop and Double-click which cannot be done
by simple WebElement commands. To handle those types of advance actions we have
the Actions class in Selenium.
we can perform complex user interaction using the Actions class.
Action Class, actually it is not a class but an Interface

TODO What is the difference between Actions Class and Action Class in Selenium?
Actions is a class that is based on a builder design pattern.
This is a user-facing API for emulating complex user gestures.

Whereas Action is an Interface which represents a single user-interaction action.
It contains one of the most widely used methods perform().
 build method is called inside the perform method automatically.

TODO  There are a lot of methods in this class which can be categorized into two main categories:
Keyboard Events
Mouse Events

TODO Different Methods for performing Keyboard Events:
keyDown(modifier key): Performs a modifier key press.
sendKeys(keys to send ): Sends keys to the active web element.
keyUp(modifier key): Performs a modifier key release.

TODO  Different Methods for performing Mouse Events:
click(): Clicks at the current mouse location.
doubleClick(): Performs a double-click at the current mouse location.
contextClick() : Performs a context-click at middle of the given element.
clickAndHold(): Clicks (without releasing) in the middle of the given element.
dragAndDrop(source, target): Click-and-hold at the location of the source element, moves to the location of the target element
dragAndDropBy(source, xOffset, yOffset):  Click-and-hold at the location of the source element, moves by a given offset
moveByOffset(Test_Concept.x-offset, y-offset): Moves the mouse from its current position (or 0,0) by the given offset
moveToElement(toElement): Moves the mouse to the middle of the element
release(): Releases the depressed left mouse button at the current mouse location


Let's see what happens internally when invoke the TODO perform() method above:

Move to Element:  contextClick() method first performs mouseMove to the middle of the element location. This function performs the right click at the middle of the web element.
Build: build() method is used to generate a composite action containing all actions. But if you observe, we have not invoked it in our above command.
       The build is executed in the perform method internally.
Perform: perform() method performs the actions we have specified. But before that, it internally invokes build() method first. After the build, the action is performed.


dragAndDrop: Here, we saw how to use Drag and Drop Action in Selenium where we need to drag and drop the source element to target
dragAndDropBy: Here, we saw how to drag and drop the source element in a horizontal and vertical direction by the specified offset
