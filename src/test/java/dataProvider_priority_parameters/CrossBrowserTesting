Cross-browser testing is the process of testing our website on different browsers
and operating systems. With cross-browser testing, we make sure that the site is rendered
the same in every browser. We can perform cross-browser testing either manually or
in an automated way, but the manual method is very tedious.
The reason being that while performing cross-browser testing,
we do not only care about the browsers but their different versions and the operating systems too.
So just imagine the permutations of so many browsers with so many versions (Chrome is on 83)
and operating systems. Thus, a better way is to choose an automated way.

We perform the automated cross-browser testing with the help of Selenium and TestNG,
but before learning the code, it's better to understand why we perform cross-browser testing.

Need for Cross-Browser Testing
As I mentioned above, nobody knows what browser user loves to open the websites.
It can be Google Chrome, Safari, or Opera Mini. Consider you, as a developer,
have Google Chrome on your desktop on which you are developing the website.
Since you have been developing the website concerning Chrome, it will render correctly on the browser.
But now, when you publish the site, you are assuming that every one of your users is on Google Chrome.
You must keep in mind that Google Chrome has a 62% share in browser statistics.
So, you just lost 38% of your users without even letting them see the product.
